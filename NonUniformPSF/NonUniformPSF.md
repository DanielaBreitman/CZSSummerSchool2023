# Question

## Big Question

## What is your Scientific motivation?

## What are some of the limitations you face in this problem? For example, is it too slow right now? Is it very tedious to iterate through different configuration?

## Is there some criterion a solution has to fulfill? For example, it has to be able to process n examples (throughput), or it has to be accurate down to some precision limit.

## Is uncertainty important?

## Is there some smoothness condition you think would matter?

## How do we validate the accuracy

# Dataset

## How much data do you have for training? Hundreds of GB? MB? or no data at all?

## What's the dimension of your input and output? Is it constant or variable?

## Do you expect the underlying process to be stochastic?

## How many data channels you have?

## Provide a short example to access and construct the test problem.

# Current status

# Potential method
